You can play a vital role in supporting the energy transition by helping to map electrical grids in your local area. These grids need modernization to meet the demands of electrification and decarbonization, but a lack of reliable data is a major barrier. Grid data provides governments, utilities, developers, and researchers with the information needed to plan effectively. That's where you come in.</p> <p>Despite the urgent need to expand and upgrade electricity infrastructure, there is currently no open global standard for cross-border grid data. OpenStreetMap has emerged as the unofficial, de facto standard used by both industry and academia. Some countries have good grid coverage, but many in the Global South are still lacking. This gap limits rural energy access and slows down climate action:</p>        Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.      <p>       Key Recommendation - International Energy Agency: How to implement the COP28 energy goals </p> <p>That is why Open Energy Transition has launched this open initiative in collaboration with Datactivist, Jungle Bus, Dynartio and Infrageomatics. We are working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an open digital twin of the European grid, but also to expand the global coverage of the transmission grid in OpenStreetMap from around 70% to 98% by 2028. It's ambitious yet achievable with your help.</p> <p>OpenStreetMap's already extensive data on the electrical grid can be browsed on Open Infrastructure Map, showing the global scale of data collected since 2008, mostly by volunteers.</p> <p>A global community of citizen contributors creates and maintains data on the core infrastructures of our modern society.

We map transmission lines that link cities. The transmission grid infrastructure is so large that it can be traced and mapped using open satellite images. However, the distribution grid cannot be mapped sufficiently well using open satellite images alone and therefore requires strong collaboration with local communities and authorities. For this reason, this is not currently our main focus. If you are interested in contributing to the distribution side, however, you should start by mapping distribution substations, most of which can also be classified using satellite images. If you are local and/or have local knowledge, you are welcome to map any infrastructure you are familiar with.</p>"},{"location":"questions/#wont-all-of-this-be-solved-by-ai-soon","title":"Won't all of this be solved by AI soon?","text":"<p>However, to ensure data quality, each data point in OpenStreetMap must be set and validated by a human. This prevents OpenStreetMap from becoming flooded with synthetic, unvalidated data that would not be suitable as ground truth in the long term. Furthermore, there are currently no detection methods that can accurately identify power towers and the course of transmission lines using classic RGB satellites alone. Grid mapping is a task that requires a high degree of expertise and contextual understanding. Due to the high relevance of this data, stochastic generation of the grid by AI is also not recommended. To validate this data, specialists must perform active grid mapping. However, we are currently evaluating the use of open-source substation detection based on Sentinel 2 data to provide another hint layer of substations for the mappers.</p>"},{"location":"questions/#does-publishing-this-data-create-a-security-risk","title":"Does publishing this data create a security risk?","text":"<p>No, publishing grid data through MapYourGrid does not meaningfully increase security risks. This concern is understandable\u2014after all, electrical grids are critical infrastructure. However, multiple studies and real-world practices show that open grid data does not elevate threat levels, for several key reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Much of the grid is already visible and documented. Transmission lines are easily observable in satellite imagery and by anyone on the ground. Most Substations are already in platforms like Google Maps. Major institutions, including government agencies, have publicly shared detailed grid data for decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sophisticated actors already have better data. State-sponsored or malicious actors do not rely on OpenStreetMap. They have access to more advanced tools, commercial imagery, or even insider or cyber channels. Blocking public access doesn\u2019t prevent their activity\u2014it only hinders legitimate use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open data helps defenders more than attackers. Transparency allows utilities, researchers, and planners to spot weaknesses, model failures, and improve resilience. Public access to routing data supports cross-border planning and faster emergency response.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cSecurity through obscurity\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Hiding infrastructure details often impedes innovation and risk mitigation. As noted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), obscurity is not a reliable security strategy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>MapYourGrid builds on a decade of public infrastructure mapping, including global comparisons showing alignment with government datasets. Our mission is to democratize access for resilience, transparency, and innovation, not to expose anything adversaries don\u2019t already know.

The following strategies and tools will help you to extend existing transmission grid networks on OpenStreetMap. As a rule of thumb: The larger the towers and substations, the higher the voltage and the greater their relevance to the transmission grid. Priority should therefore be given to large, high-voltage infrastructure first. Please consider the following strategies and the associated processes as recommendations only. Ultimately, the most efficient strategy is the one that enables you to work on the electrical grid with passion and motivation over a longer period of time. The strategies can be divided roughly into two phases:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Pioneer Mapping Strategies: To ensure the power grid has the best possible coverage, we recommend beginning with Pioneer Mapping in each country. Several strategies are employed at this stage to identify the location of all lines, power poles, and substations. Rather than reducing issues in the grid, the main focus is on increasing coverage and extending the geographic information of the grid. This may result in an increased total number of issues in the grid. These strategies focus primarily on mapping the geographical location of power lines, towers, plants and substations, rather than technical grid details. They require good eyesight, fast mapping skills and an understanding of situations in which satellite data is insufficient for consistent grid mapping.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technical Mapping Strategies: This phase involves solving more complex grid issues that require a fundamental understanding of the electrical grid. This includes mapping voltages, the number of circuits and routing issues. During this phase, the initial mapping work is validated against multiple sources to ensure its plausibility. These sources could include official maps from grid operators, statistics about grid length, and other official data. The main focus of these strategies is to minimise the number of complex quality issues in the grid.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"tools/#pioneer-mapping-strategies-and-tools","title":"Pioneer Mapping Strategies and Tools","text":""},{"location":"tools/#todo-plugin","title":"todo Plugin","text":"<p>The todo plugin is used for almost all pioneer mapping strategies, systematically stepping through a dataset of <code>hints</code>.</p>  A simple but very efficient way of mapping the network is the continuation of \u201cUnfinished Transmission Lines loaded into the todo plugin\u201d.

If you are mapping an interconnector between two countries and want to see what\u2019s mapped on the \u201cother\u201d side of the border, you can either do a quick Download from OSM in a new layer or use the following Overpass query:</p> Overpass Query Example <ol> <li>Copy this query and paste it into \u201cDownload from Overpass API\u201d in JOSM.</li> <li>Draw a small bounding box in the slippy map, then run the query to download.</li> <li><p>Explanation: The query finds nodes in your bounding box, detects their admin area (level 4 by default), and fetches all power infrastructure within it. You can adjust the \u201cadmin level\u201d in the query (e.g. level 2 for national, level 6 for province) by editing the <code>admin_level</code> parameter in the download tab.

Select the powerplantmatching button and click on any country to download a GeoJSON file listing rejected power plants. Once downloaded, the file can be opened in JOSM as a hint layer to help improve tagging. You can do this by reviewing the reason why the power plant was not considered and adding the missing data. For example, a common reason is the lack of a technology tag like <code>plant:method=run-of-river</code> or <code>plant:method=reservoir</code> on hydro power plants, or <code>plant:method=wind_turbine</code> on wind farms relations.</p> <p>Follow the steps below to help improve rejected power plants in OSM:</p> <ol> <li>Use the Map It\ud83d\udccd page to download the rejected power plant layer for a given country.</li> <li>Open the GeoJSON file in JOSM as a new layer.</li> <li>Press CTRL+A and click 'Add' in the 'Todo' window.</li> <li>Switch to your OSM transmission or power layer.</li> <li>Step through the rejected entries by pressing 'Mark' in JOSM.</li> <li>Improve tagging to enhance the quality of OSM data.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/firstrename/","title":"Liberate the Grid","text":"Liberate the Grid <p>Andreas Hernandez Denyer  \u00b7  April 25, 2025 </p> <p>Welcome to our Blog.
